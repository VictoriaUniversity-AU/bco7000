### Part 2: Data Wrangling and visualization 38 marks

For all tables below, you need to use the RMarkdown functionality to present tables (`kable`). 

1. Display the first 10 rows of the dataset using `kable()` function (1 marks). 

2. Using `skim()` display the summary of variables.

Write 2-3 sentences with your explanation. (2 marks)

Think about the task to predict a community type or US_region based on their menu: what variables may be useful? Are all of them correct type? (2 marks)

3. Use `fct_reorder` and `parse_number` functions to create a factor variable `family_income`(2 mark).

4. What is the number of people who celebrate? (1 mark)

5. What are categories and insights for each main dish served and the method it is prepared? (2 marks)

6. Create 3 different data viz showing insights for main dish served and the method. Provide your own legend and use themes.

7. How many use cranberry sauce? How many use gravy? 2marks

8-9. What is the distribution of those who celebrate across income ranges. Create a data viz.

10. Use the following code to create a new data set 2 mark

`
select(id, starts_with("side"),
         starts_with("pie"),
         starts_with("dessert")) %>%
  select(-side15, -pie13, -dessert12) %>%
  gather(type, value, -id) %>%
  filter(!is.na(value),
         !value %in% c("None", "Other (please specify)")) %>%
  mutate(type = str_remove(type, "\\d+"))
`

Write 2-3 sentences with your explanation of what it does. (4 marks)

11. Intall package `widyr` and use `pairwise_cor()` function https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/widyr/versions/0.1.3/topics/pairwise_cor
Write 2-3 sentences with your explanation of what it does. (2 marks)

Use this code for the new dataset

`
pairwise_cor(value, id, sort = TRUE)

`
Write 1 sentence with your explanation of what insights it shows. (2 marks)

13. Use `lm()` or randomForest() function to build a model that predict a family income based on data in the dataset. 8 marks

Compare 3 models using different set of input variables. Use different number of variables.

Explain your choice of variables (3 sentences) 

Write 2 sentences explaining which model os best.
